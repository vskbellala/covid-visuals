Testing for COVID-19 takes many forms, to varying degrees of effectiveness.

## Why get tested?

If you show COVID-19 symptoms, had close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with a COVID-19 positive individual, have taken part in high risk activities (such as traveling or interacting with COVID-19 positive patients), or been suggested to get tested by healthcare providers, GET TESTED!

Always self-isolate pending the results of your test, and take precautions to protect yourself and others around you regardless of the outcome.
