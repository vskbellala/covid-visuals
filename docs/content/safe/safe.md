## What Should You Do if You Believe You Have COVID-19?
Take the following steps if you believe you have COVID-19 [[1]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/index.html) [[2]](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-cb-what-to-do-if-i-think-i-have-coronavirus-20200303-duqyvtkec5adrjweigbptdl36u-story.html).

1. Get tested to make sure you have the virus.
    - If you test ***positive*** for the virus, state and local health departments will take action to mitigate the threat which means they will identify people that you had contact with and test them as well.
2. Call/Visit your primary physician.
    - If you are experiencing minor symptoms, do not go to see your doctor, call them instead to find out how to take care of yourself.
    - Only visit a doctor if you experience severe symptoms and if symptoms do occur, call your physician before visiting.
3. Stay at home if symptoms are minor and if symptoms get worse seek emergency medical care.
4. Stay isolated from people at home until:
    - It has been 10 days since symptoms first appeared.
    - 24 hours have passed with no fever.
    
*Loss of taste or smell may persist for weeks or months and does not delay the end of isolation.*
