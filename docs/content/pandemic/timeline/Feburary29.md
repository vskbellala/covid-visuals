###### February 29

### New Technologies Approved

The FDA approves the use of new testing technologies at hospitals and healthcare facilities after increased criticism over response and lack of testing done by the CDC. This new policy would allow laboratories to begin the use of supported COVID-19 diagnostics before the FDA has completed the review of the Emergency Use Authorization requests [[12]](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/29/fda-allows-new-diagnostic-technologies-to-test-for-coronavirus-before-receiving-emergency-approvals/).
