Throughout the year 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused enough damage to the United States to effectively shut down the country. This respiratory disease is especially dangerous to the older population. The following is a timeline of major events in the United States during the coronavirus outbreak. 
Our goal in this timeline is to present a broad overview of the diseaseâ€™s progression in the USA and how the country has responded on a federal and national level. On this site, we also discuss smaller scale events in individual cities as part of our case studies. Throughout the timeline you will encounter visuals, developed by us, presenting COVID-19 data, explanations of current COVID-19 research, including a list of the basic mathematical and technical concepts needed to understand them, and more.
