## [Excess Deaths and Immunoprotection during 1918–1920 Pandemic, Taiwan](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/10/08-0811_article)  ||  Historical Context

An analysis of how the 1918 pandemic swept through Taiwan. The authors use statistics and epidemiology to come to conclusions about the impacts of a pandemic of a similar size in today’s modernized Taiwan. Given the much larger population of Taiwan nowadays, there is a high possibility that another pandemic of similar size could be much more deadly than the virus outbreak of 1918 and 1920. Basic knowledge of statistics regarding standard deviations and confidence intervals would be helpful in reading this. We begin to see how pandemics could be much more deadly in our globalized world, and the article urges us to prepare as such.

The author also urges for better communication between public health professionals and the populace. It is highlighted how similar the situation we are in right now is to that of older pandemics. It also points out the inadequate way we prepared in light of pandemics from long ago regarding how we never replenished medical supplies. The cause of our unpreparedness is unquestionably ourselves. The importance of learning from the past is a major topic.
